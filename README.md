# University Challenge Software Controller

### About
The source code for a school university challenge competition.  
Aka it controls the buzzers (you can press a buzzer, it lights up, and plays a nice sound)  
Runs on a heavily customised raspberry pi configuration, with a cool hardware setup for the buzzers themselves/audio.
